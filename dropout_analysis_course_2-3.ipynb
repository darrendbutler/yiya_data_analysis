    "# Modeling and Predicting Student Dropout in Yiya Air Science Courses\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, our first aim to identify the points in the Yiya Air Science courses 2 and 3 where students dropout. There are different ways extents and ways to measure drop out. For example, dropout can be defined as a:\n",
    "1. **Usage Gap**, where the time since the students last response is more than a certain amount of days e.g (e.g more than 7 days since last response). This can be seen as students being \"on track\" or \"behind\".\n",
    "2. **Total Response Stop**, where a student has sent their last response to the system before completing all tasks\n",
    "3. **Total Question Stop**, where a student stops submitting graded problems in the course before completing all tasks [(Borella, et al., 2019)](https://mitili.mit.edu/sites/default/files/project-documents/a24-Borrella_Caballero_Ponce_2019.pdf)\n",
    "4. **Total Completion Stop**, where a student stops completing tasks (lesson modules and tests)\n",
    "5. **Opt out** - student voluntarily unenrolls from the course without achieving a certificate [(Tinto, 1975)](https://www-tandfonline-com.cmu.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1080/01587919.2017.1369006#)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second aim is to measure and visualize the rate of each of these dropout metrics among students over time and each course step. We can do so by diving the total occurances by the number of studnets. (Counts of students meeting dropout criteria / total number of students).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our third aim is to identify features (variables) that are predictive of dropout with a classification model. Prior research suggests a need to refine success and dropout metrics [(Kohler, 2019)](https://www-tandfonline-com.cmu.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1080/01587919.2017.1369006). It is uncertain if we have all of the following features in our data. However, we can try features grounded in previous theories, empircal results, and our best judgement on what makes sense for the context of the learning environment and the student population.  but some features that we may be able to use in our model and evaluate for predictive power include: \n",
    "- Student's date of first submission of a problem [(Liyanagunawardena, 2014)](https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/36002/)\n",

    "We can try to align participant types with [Yiya User Definitions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KNgPFdRSBniQouaKIQQPuI-DlAL-2xs70t4rpps5Qq4/edit)\n",
    "- Completion Behavior\n",
    "    - Number of lesson modules (tasks) completed\n",
    "    - Number of lesson questions completed\n",
    "    - Number of questions answered correctly\n",
    "    - Number of tests they've completed \n",
    "    - Whether they are a returning learner - There should be a record for each Registration, Previously registered key in response as well. Data team will have to get back to us on how to best query the data to get an accurate user.\n",
    "- Time on Task metric\n",
    "    - Minutes spent on a task / Average time of session - We can use the telcomsession table and the created and duration feature. There can be telecom issues so users can get kicked out before completing the script. We'll have to consider this. We may have to compare with the tasks table.\n",
    "- Review Behaviors \n",
    "    - Number of Times Revising Previous Lesson\n",
    "- Effect of payment\n",
    "    - Payment Status (Scholarship or Self Paid with mobile money) \n",
    "    - payment survey question - Required question in the response table. Shariffa will share the key. \n",

    "Note about \"effect of payment\": The date at which non-paid users lost access to course 3 was [*To be confirmed by yiya team, date was potentially nov 4th*]\n",

    "# Exploring the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Yiya has a large database containing course content, user information, and interactions. The data spans multiple courses. The Entity Relationship Diagram below shows the relationships between the tables and the fields each table contains. We have the following tables:\n",
    "- `content` - which describes the text or audio content users see or hear on their phones\n",
    "- `outbound` - which tracks cellular data being from the system to users\n",
    "- `inbound` - which tracks cellular data being to the system from users\n",
    "- `response` - which describes the values users select from menus, surveys, lessons, tests, and other activities\n",
    "- `user` - which describes the status of each user\n",
    "- `task` - which records completions of tasks i.e completion of surveys, lessons, tests, etc.\n",
    "- `registration` - which records each record of a user registration for a course\n",
    "- `course` - which records each instance of a course run\n",
    "- `channel`- **TECH TEAM INPUT NEEDED:** *the purpose of this table is unclear to the author of this notebook at time of writing*\n",
    "- `telecommession` - which describes each session started on USSD by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "❗️ Additional notes are needed on conditions under which each record is generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations for Future Tables and Fields**\n",
    "- Survey table - Adding a table for surveys would help with the duplicate response problem in the response table. I recommend logging survey responses after the last survey question has been completed to ensure accurate survey data.\n",
    "- Task Table Fields\n",
    "    - time_taken - record the time between a user starting a tasks and completing a task after the task has been completed\n",
    "    - score - record the score for lessons or tests after they have been completed. non scored tasks can be left empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have had an overview of the tables, we can quickly look at each table to identify data that can be used to model student dropout behaviors."
